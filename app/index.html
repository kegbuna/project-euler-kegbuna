      <h1 id="home">Welcome</h1>
      <p>This is a site made using the Google Web Starter Kit.</p>
      <p>I decided I needed to share something on the internet that was meaningful, so I grabbed the template and went to work.</p>
      <p>My plan is to share my solutions to <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems, starting with the most popular (solved) ones.</p>
      <p>There won't likely be anything of value on here for a year, when I finally get to the ones other people find hard. (lol)</p>

      <h2 id="project-euler">Project Euler</h2>
      <p>Here is where we'll begin. <span class="todo">TODO::Add a js generated navigation bar above (below?) this text.</span></p>
      <h3 id="problem-1" class="problem-title">Problem 1</h3>
      <div class="problem">
        <p class="problem-text">If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>
        <p class="problem text">Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Solution 1</h3>
      <p>It would be easy to just count up all the way to 1000, checking to see if each number is divisible by 3 or 5, and then adding that to the array to be added, right? That means traversing 1000 member dataset though, which is pretty wasteful. I'll try splitting it into 2, one for 3 and one for 5, but I'll need to check to make sure I don't add those numbers twice!</p>

      </div>
      <h3>Solution 3</h3>
      <p>I know this is likely not the most elegant solution, but it's mine :-). I start with an array of primes, starting with 2, and an empty array of prime factors. I try to divide the current number by my array of primes, and then add it to the prime factors array if it works. I don't know off the top of my head every single prime number, so for each check I add another prime to my array of possible primes. When the quotient is 1, I stop. </p>
